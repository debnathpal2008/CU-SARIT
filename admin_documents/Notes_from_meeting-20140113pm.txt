DECISIONS REGARDING DIVS
STRUCTURAL DIVISION

SINGLE TEXTS
div
  @type 

TEXT + COMMENTARY

head
trailer
postscript
HEAD REND="NONE" for headers not present in the source text
changes in headers should be noted in revision description
or use LABEL for these kinds of headers?

LABEL
for headers?

GENERAL SOLUTION
ab @type=mula 
  for prose

QUOTATION MARKS
forget about them

LG, P, and QUOTE
iti in LG or outside of it?

LG
  keep numbers in, even if n is used
SEG
  keep daṇḍas in segment

LB 
  guidelines for lb elements
  start counting from first line, not including header
  
PB 
  add xml:ids for reference purposes

XML:LANG
  attribute of text
  variations/deviations also defined
  
XML:ID
  abbreviation
  chapter
  number
  (involves abbreviated title of text and implicit reference system)
  FUTURE PROOF: reference could be to a future resource

CRITICAL ANNOTATIONS
for ADVANCED texts: 
app -- parallel segmentation (only for variant readings)
  if possible, use lem
  otherwise, don't
note element for all other purposes
for BASIC texts: note in app element

no explicit lemma (either in sense of "preferred reading" or "point of attachment")
very explicit about use of lemma
only makes sense in the context of a particular encoding strategy

REFERENCES
  typology of references
  editions typeset pratikas differently from other kinds of references
  ref type="pratika"
  quotation
    less direct reference?
  
CITATIONS

PAGE RANGES
  how to encode using ref?

SEMANTIC ANNOTATION
name = persName with @ref attribute

CORRECTIONS
  integrate them into text as NOTES with TYPE="CORR" attribute
